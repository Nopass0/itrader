# Startup Script Fixes

## Issue
The `start-dev.sh` script was terminating immediately after showing "Cleaning up existing processes..."

## Root Cause
The script was killing itself because it included `'bun.*start-dev.ts'` in the list of processes to kill during cleanup. When pkill matched this pattern, it terminated the script itself.

## Solution
1. Removed `'bun.*start-dev.ts'` from the processes to kill list
2. Enhanced the shell script with informative messages
3. Used `exec` to replace the shell process with the bun process

## Fixed Files

### /start-dev.ts
```typescript
// Removed this line from processesToKill array:
// 'bun.*start-dev.ts'
```

### /start-dev.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "üöÄ Starting iTrader development environment..."
echo "üìù Backend (WebSocket API): http://localhost:3001"
echo "üé® Frontend: http://localhost:3000"
echo "üî• Hot reload enabled for both services"
echo ""

# Run the development script
exec bun run start-dev.ts
```

## How to Run
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

The script will:
1. Clean up any existing processes
2. Start the backend on port 3001 (WebSocket API)
3. Start the frontend on port 3000
4. Open a browser to http://localhost:3000
5. Enable hot reload for both services

# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Issue
After logging in, users were seeing multiple "Server unavailable" notifications even though the connection was working properly. The logs showed successful connections but the UI was displaying error messages.

## Root Causes
1. Multiple simultaneous connection checks during authentication
2. Socket reconnection when setting auth token caused temporary disconnects
3. Rate limiting wasn't properly implemented for toast notifications
4. Duplicate event listeners and logging
5. Auth provider was triggering disconnects that looked like server issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Rate Limiting for Connection Checks
- Added throttling to prevent checks more frequent than every 5 seconds
- Added force parameter to allow critical checks to bypass throttling
- Implemented promise deduplication to prevent simultaneous checks

### 2. Toast Notification Rate Limiting
- Added 10-second minimum interval between toast notifications
- Prevents spam when connection state changes rapidly
- Only shows notifications when there's an actual state change

### 3. Improved Token Management
- Check if token has changed before triggering reconnection
- Disable auto-reconnect during auth token updates
- Proper cleanup of reconnection state

### 4. Better Disconnect Handling
- Differentiate between client-side disconnects (auth changes) and server disconnects
- Add 2-second grace period for client disconnects before marking as offline
- Remove duplicate disconnect handlers in auth provider

### 5. Reduced Console Logging
- Wrap all debug logs in NODE_ENV checks
- Only log initial connection, not reconnections
- Reduce verbosity of API calls in production

### 6. Event Listener Cleanup
- Remove existing listeners before adding new ones
- Prevent duplicate event handlers
- Clean up reconnection timeouts properly

## Components Modified
- `/frontend/hooks/useApiCheckSingleton.ts` - Main connection check logic
- `/frontend/services/socket-api.ts` - Socket client with better reconnection
- `/frontend/components/providers/auth-provider.tsx` - Removed redundant disconnect handling
- `/frontend/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx` - New simple status component

## Result
- Single connection check on login instead of multiple
- No false "server unavailable" notifications
- Cleaner console output in production
- Better handling of auth token changes
- More reliable connection status indication
